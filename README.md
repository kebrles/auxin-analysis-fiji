# Batch processing and analysis of microscopic cell images using [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) (ImageJ)

This repository contains [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) macros for partial automation and batch processing of microscopic images of cells. Fluorescent signal was measured in: 
a) cell nuclei 
b) cell membranes 
c) intracelular signal  

A more detailed description of the analysis process and macro functions can be found on this projects [Wiki](https://github.com/kebrles/auxin-analysis-fiji/wiki) page.

# Tools and usage
[Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) macros are run manually from the macro editor in Fiji GUI. 

Python (> 3.10) scripts are used only for merging output .csv files generated by Fiji macros.
